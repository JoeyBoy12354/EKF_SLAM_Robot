README 1-3
We had straight difference influence the runs

README 4
We removed straight difference from the runs and added motion noise as:
float sigma_odo_x = 0.1;
float sigma_odo_y = 0.1;
float sigma_odo_theta = 1.7;
This proved to make that the EKF actually changes the x y and z values. It did not do this for
1-3.
